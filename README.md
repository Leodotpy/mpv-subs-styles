# Tutorial

Only  a few simple steps are needed to start using these styles



1. Locate and open your ```mpv.conf``` file located on windows in ```C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\mpv```.

2. Copy and paste the subtitle profiles into the ```mpv.conf``` file (try moving them to <u>the bottom</u> of the file incase somewhere else doesn't work as it could be interfering with some other profiles if your mpv.conf file is already populated).

3. Set the subtitle profile you want to use by replacing "default" in the copied ```--profile=default``` line to the profile header of the subtitles you want to use (for example ```--profile=bubbles``` for the bubbles style).

4. Download all fonts needed for the styles as linked in the profiles (if custom) and place them (the .ttf files) in your mpv installation fonts folder located at  ```C:\Program Files\MPV\fonts```.
